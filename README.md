# Tapps-Artifact
Project developed as a sample of my work to be submitted with a job application.

The game has simple graphics, all created using either Unity's built-in tools for 3D meshes or simple image editing software for 2D sprites in the UI. The purpose of the game is to demonstrate some gameplay mechanics and how to port them to a mobile application.

In the game the player controls a green cube and has to start a quest with the red cube NPC, whom requests him to collect a few items for him, transform into something useful and drop them in his collection. To do so the player has to go to the resources collection area and drag what he thinks would be suitable for each one of the requested items, drag the container cube back to the NPC and, if the components are a match what the NPC wanted, a new collectible is generated for the player to take to the collection. After collecting all the 5 items requested the player wins the game.
